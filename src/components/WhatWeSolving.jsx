                                The diminishing retail space is primarily a result of the continuously rising real estate costs. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) encounter challenges in persuading their customers effectively due to limited display areas. Consequently, they often experience lower conversion rates when compared to larger outlets or online retail giants.
